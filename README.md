NemDev's Athletics Game is an ambitious project to create a game simulating track and field.

The idea of the game is to put yourself in the position of an Athletics coach as you try to help your athletes improve and become the best they can be through advice and training intesities. Each athlete will act unique as they progress, adapting different racing strategies as they develop into better athletes, learn from their mistakes in previous races, take your feedback after completing races, and watch the strategies of their favorite athletes and legends within the same universe. You will have the ability to customize the training intesitiy of every individual, give athletes feedback on how they're doing/performing, and overall get to watch your athletes grow and become legends.

Will you take over a high school program and start sending the athlete down the path of success? Will you be a college coach, aiding in each athlete's transition from amateur to the pro level while chasing national championships of your own? Will you form a team of pro athletes and have your athletes compete for the ultimate prize: Olympic gold? Find out in NemDev's Athletics Game!
